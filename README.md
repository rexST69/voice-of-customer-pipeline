Market Intelligence Pipeline: Scraper & NLP Analyzer

📖 Executive Summary

In the age of digital products, customer feedback is unstructured, messy, and voluminous. This project is an end-to-end Market Intelligence Pipeline designed to scrape, process, and extract actionable insights from Reddit discussions.

For Product Managers and Marketers, this tool automates the "User Feedback Loop," transforming thousands of random comments into structured data regarding user sentiment, feature requests (topic modeling), and feature associations (network analysis).

📂 Project Architecture

The project consists of two independent but linked modules:

reddit_scraper.py (The Data Miner): Connects to the Reddit API to harvest raw user discussions based on specific keywords (e.g., "Artificial Intelligence", "iPhone 11", "SaaS").

text_analysis.py (The Insight Engine): A robust NLP pipeline that cleans the data and performs statistical analysis to visualize trends.

🛠 Prerequisites & Setup (The "Interruptors")

Before running the code, you must clear these hurdles. These are the most common points of failure for new users.

1. System Requirements

Python 3.8 or higher installed.

Internet Connection (Required for Scraper and NLTK downloads).

2. Reddit API Access (Crucial Step)

The scraper will fail immediately without valid credentials. You cannot scrape Reddit anonymously via scripts.

Log in to [suspicious link removed].

Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps.

Click "Create Another App..." at the bottom.

Name: MyMarketScraper (or similar).

Select: script (This is important!).

Redirect URI: http://localhost:8080 (This is a placeholder, but required).

Click Create app.

Copy your keys:

Client ID: The string under the app name (e.g., yO_S3cr3t_ID).

Client Secret: The string next to "secret".

3. Library Installation

Open your terminal/command prompt in the project folder and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Potential Interruptor: If you get a "pip not found" error, ensure Python is added to your system PATH variables.

🚀 Usage Guide

Phase 1: Data Collection

Open reddit_scraper.py in your code editor.

Paste your Client ID and Client Secret into the CREDENTIALS dictionary at the top.

(Optional) Change SEARCH_QUERY to whatever product/market you are analyzing (e.g., "Tesla", "Marketing", "ChatGPT").

Run the script:

python reddit_scraper.py


Success Check: You will see a file named ai_dataset.csv appear in your folder.

Phase 2: Data Analysis

Ensure ai_dataset.csv exists.

Run the analysis pipeline:

python text_analysis.py
